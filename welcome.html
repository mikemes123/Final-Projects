    <p class="caption">A simple yet important app</p>
    <p class = "text">  Evia is an app designed to help with the simple yet constantly forgotten task of drinking enough water daily. According to the U.S. National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine the average person whether male or female should drink at least 11.5 cups of water daily. Despite this, people fail to reach this daily goal, with the help of Evia users will be reminded periodically to drink water helping them reach the daily water intake.
        Evia is more than just a reminder app; it is a comprehensive hydration companion designed to seamlessly integrate into the lives of its users. By harnessing the power of modern technology, Evia ensures that hydration becomes an effortless part of daily routines, even for the busiest individuals.
        One of the key features of Evia is its customizable reminder system. Users can set their preferred hydration intervals based on their unique schedules and needs, ensuring that they receive timely prompts without feeling overwhelmed. Whether it's a gentle nudge every hour or a more spaced-out reminder throughout the day, Evia adapts to fit each user's lifestyle, making it easier to stay on track with hydration goals.</p>
