    <p class="captionabout">Michael Meseret</p>
    <p class = "abouttext">  Evia was founded by Michael Meseret, a sixteen year old first-generation Eritrean who constantly forgets to get in his daily water intake. He created Evia to facilitate the important task of getting in oneâ€™s water intake. Although water intake is constantly marginalized not getting enough water can lead to dehydration, kidney stones, urinary tract infections, constipation, skin problems, decreased physical performance, impaired cognitive function, impaired kidney function, and many more. </p>
